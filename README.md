# Code Comparer

Compare code using [Adaptive Comparative Judgement]() to build a scale using a Rasch model. For determining the 'quality' of things without using standardisation approaches.

Everything happens in the console so far. See src/index.js for what's going on.

## Usage

```
npm install
npm start
```
