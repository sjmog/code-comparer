# Code Comparer

Compare code using [Adaptive Comparative Judgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_comparative_judgement) to build a scale using a Rasch model. For determining the 'quality' of things without using standardisation approaches.

## Usage

```
npm install
npm start
```

- Do some judgements. In this example, defaults to 5 judgements.
- Get the results of your judgement cast onto a Rasch model and in logits.
